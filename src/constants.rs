How do PC™id security enhancements impact me?
We’ve updated our password requirements for PC™ id as part of our ongoing efforts to help secure our members’ accounts. This means if you have a PC™ id with any of the above mentioned sites, you may need to create a longer and stronger password. Why have you changed your password requirements? This is a part of the new normal for online business and our growing privacy and security standards. We believe helping to protect the privacy and security of online information is the responsibility of both the company and the individual and this is one way we’re doing our part to help keep your information safe. In the coming weeks, we will introduce further measures, including two-step verification.
Why have you changed your password requirements?
We believe helping to protect the privacy and security of online information is the responsibility of both the company and the individual and this is one way we’re doing our part to help keep your information safe. We have also introduced two-step verification to the process.
How do I make a strong password?
Use a sentence or phrase that only you know. Spaces, numbers and special characters are recommended. The PC™id password requirement is a minimum of 10 characters. Also, password managers can be a helpful tool to ensure you have strong and unique passwords for all your online accounts. Leveraging a password manager allows for easy accessibility to manage unique passwords.
Why am I being asked to update my password when I try to access my account?
We’ve updated our password requirements. Creating a new password is easy – the next time you open your app or login to the website you will be prompted to create a password that meets the increased security requirements
Why doesn’t my old password work anymore?
Your password no longer meets our updated requirements. Please create a new password using the “forgot password” process on the 
sign in page.
What is two-step verification?
Two-step verification helps protect your account by requiring two different forms of identity: your password, and a contact method (such as a cell phone number or email). Whenever you sign into your PC Optimum™ account from a new device or location, you’ll receive a security code via email or text to enter as part of your sign-in.
When will I receive my PC Optimum™ points?
If you earned PC Optimum™ points on your order, they will be awarded to your account 2 to 3 days after your order has been shipped. If you entered a promo code to receive Points from a PC OptimumMC offer, these points will show up in your account 3 to 4 weeks after your order has been shipped.
How do I create an account?
To create your account, select SIGN IN at the top right corner of the homepage, then CREATE AN ACCOUNT.
What is a PC™id?
A PC™id is a universal login that can be used to access your accounts across a variety of Loblaws and Shoppers Drug Mart online platforms. If you are registered with JoeFresh.ca, Pharmaprix.ca or online grocery, you already have one. Your PC™id is the email address and password used as your login information for your Pharmaprix.ca account.

How do I manage my account settings and information?
To manage your account settings and information, sign into your account. Select SIGN IN and then YOUR ACCOUNT. There you can view and update your email address and password, view your order history, and either add, edit, or delete addresses and payment information.
How do I track my order?
To track your order, sign into your account and click on ORDER HISTORY to see your complete list of orders. Click on your most recent order to view details. You will find your order tracking number under the TRACK PACKAGE(S) heading. Select the tracking number to open the carrier's website and view the status of your package. If you did not create an account, you can also find the carrier's tracking number in your Shipping Confirmation email.
How do I modify my order?
After you place an order, you have one hour to cancel it before the package is prepared for shipment. After 60 minutes, we will be unable to prevent shipment. To cancel the order, sign into your account and open the ORDER HISTORY screen. Find the order you would like to cancel and select CANCEL ORDER. You can also cancel an order from the confirmation email you received. Just select the order number in the email and cancel it from the order confirmation screen.
Where do you ship?
We currently ship to all Canadian postal codes except those in Quebec. Customers shipping to postal codes in Quebec must place their order on Pharmaprix.ca. Limited shipping options may be available in some areas. We may restrict shipping to certain addresses such as warehouses, freight forwarding/redirecting services, and hotels. U.S. and International shipping is currently unavailable.
How is tax charged on gifts?
When sending a gift order, the applicable taxes are based on the shipping address. For example, if you live in Ontario but would like to ship a package to Alberta, you will pay Alberta taxes.
What payment methods do you accept?
We accept MasterCard, VISA, VISA Debit, American Express, Apple Pay and Google Pay. U.S. credit cards are accepted if they are registered to a Canadian billing address. We are unable to accept orders from international credit cards. We can accept prepaid credit cards providing the address is registered on file with the issuing bank. We do not currently accept PayPal.
Do you accept gift cards?
Unfortunately, we do not currently accept gift cards of any kind as a method of payment.
Can I use my PC Optimum™ points to pay for my order?
Yes! 
Will the contents of my shipment be protected from cold or heat?
If you are concerned about cold or heat affecting the items in your shipment, we recommend selecting a shipping address where someone will be available to receive your package.
Which internet browsers are optimal for Pharmarix.ca?
We recommend using Google Chrome or Firefox as the optimal browsers to navigate Pharmaprix.ca.

CSV data contains filters helps you do next function
you can use it as internal DB, to construct queryPrams array and send it to server side later on
you can mention few options while asking questions to narrow down search, you don't need to list every single one to me or customer
for example if  I was talking about products with promotion for my skin
you can use CSV to talk to help customer narrow down the options.
